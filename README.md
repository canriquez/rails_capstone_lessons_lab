# Lessons Lab

This web application is a mobile application targeting freelance teachers to admin, track, and manage lessons with their students.

. The front end is based on the original design idea by [Gregoire Vella on Behance ](https://www.behance.net/gallery/19759151/Snapscan-iOs-design-and-branding?tracking_source=).
